What is TCP?

TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) is one of the main protocols in the Internet protocol suite (TCP/IP). It operates at the transport layer (Layer 4) of the OSI model and provides reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery of data between applications running on hosts communicating over an IP network.
Key Features of TCP:

    Connection-Oriented: TCP establishes a connection between two hosts before data exchange begins. This connection is maintained until all data transmission is completed.

    Reliability: TCP ensures reliable delivery of data by using acknowledgments and retransmissions. When a sender transmits data, it waits for acknowledgment from the receiver. If an acknowledgment is not received within a certain time, the sender retransmits the data.

    Ordered Data Transmission: TCP ensures that data is delivered in the same order in which it was sent. This is achieved through sequence numbers assigned to each segment of data.

    Flow Control: TCP employs flow control mechanisms to prevent a fast sender from overwhelming a slow receiver. It uses a sliding window mechanism to control the rate of data transmission.

    Congestion Control: TCP helps to avoid network congestion by adjusting the transmission rate based on network conditions. It uses algorithms like Slow Start, Congestion Avoidance, and Fast Retransmit to manage congestion.

    Full Duplex Communication: TCP supports full-duplex communication, allowing data to be transmitted in both directions simultaneously.

How TCP Works:

    Connection Establishment (Three-Way Handshake):
        Before data transfer begins, TCP establishes a connection using a three-way handshake. This involves the SYN, SYN-ACK, and ACK messages exchanged between the client and server.

    Data Transfer:
        Once the connection is established, data transfer occurs in both directions. Data is divided into segments and transmitted over the network.

    Acknowledgment and Retransmission:
        After sending each segment, the sender waits for an acknowledgment (ACK) from the receiver. If an ACK is not received within a specified timeout period, the sender retransmits the segment.

    Connection Termination (Four-Way Handshake):
        When data exchange is complete, TCP terminates the connection using a four-way handshake. This involves FIN, FIN-ACK, and ACK messages exchanged between the client and server to close the connection gracefully.

Applications of TCP:

    Web Browsing: TCP is widely used for web browsing, allowing reliable and ordered delivery of HTTP requests and responses.
    Email: Protocols like SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) and IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol) use TCP for sending and receiving emails.
    File Transfer: TCP is used for reliable file transfer protocols like FTP (File Transfer Protocol) and SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol).
    Remote Login: Protocols like SSH (Secure Shell) and Telnet use TCP for remote login sessions.

In summary, TCP is a connection-oriented protocol that provides reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery of data over IP networks. It ensures data integrity, flow control, and congestion control, making it suitable for a wide range of applications requiring guaranteed delivery of data.
